**Multi-Provider AI Agent Orchestration with Enterprise-Grade Governance**

</div>

---

## 🎯 Mission

Switchboard is a production-ready platform for orchestrating AI agents across multiple providers (OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex) with policy-based approvals, cryptographic audit trails, and comprehensive observability. Built for enterprises that need to govern autonomous agent actions while maintaining developer velocity.

**🔬 Research Edition**: This started as a personal passion project exploring agent governance, but has evolved into a comprehensive platform ready for production use.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **🔧 Multi-Provider Support** | OpenAI, AWS Bedrock AgentCore, Google Vertex AI | ✅ Production Ready |
| **🛡️ Policy-Based Governance** | OPA (Open Policy Agent) with custom rules | ✅ Production Ready |
| **✅ Human Approval Workflows** | Persistent approval system with UI | ✅ Production Ready |
| **📋 Cryptographic Audit Trails** | COSE signatures + Rekor transparency logs | ✅ Production Ready |
| **📊 Enterprise Observability** | OTLP traces, metrics, structured logging | ✅ Production Ready |
| **🔒 Security Scanning** | CodeQL, Bandit, Safety vulnerability scanning | ✅ Production Ready |
| **🚀 CI/CD Pipeline** | Automated testing, Docker builds, releases | ✅ Production Ready |
| **📦 Container Ready** | Multi-stage Docker builds for all components | ✅ Production Ready |
| **🔄 Auto Dependency Updates** | Dependabot for Python, GitHub Actions, Docker | ✅ Production Ready |
| **🧪 Comprehensive Testing** | Unit, integration, property-based, chaos testing | ✅ Production Ready |

## Why This Exists (Research Framing)

- **Enterprise agents are real** – MCP connectors launched in ChatGPT Business/Enterprise (Oct 2025), AWS Bedrock AgentCore is GA, and Vertex Agent Engine is getting priced like a platform
- **Governance is lagging** – EU GPAI Code of Practice and IETF provenance drafts call for provable oversight across tool-using agents
- **Hypothesis** – A protocol-neutral “switchboard” can sit between MCP/ACP, add policy/approvals, and emit transparency logs that satisfy risk teams without throttling builders

This repo is a research sandbox, not a product. Switchboard is a personal passion project; feel free to fork, remix, and study. Expect detailed docs, reproducible demos, and lots of TODOs for future explorers.

## New in this Iteration

- ✅ **Persistent approvals** via `switchboard.storage` (SQLite by default, Postgres ready)
- ✅ **Chaos scripts** (`scripts/chaos/`) simulating OPA outages & adapter flaps
- ✅ **Coverage & mutation** targets (`make coverage`, `make mutation`) with 90% gate
- ✅ **Cloud adapters** (AWS Bedrock AgentCore & Vertex AI Agent Engine) with dry-run defaults + live toggles
- ✅ **Expanded QA**: tox profile, Hypothesis fuzzing hooks, pytest-httpx for adapter simulation
- ✅ **Docs refresh**: research posture, onboarding guide, growth/media kit, operations runbook updates

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Option 1: Local Development (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Install dev deps
make install
# or bootstrap everything via the quickstart script
./scripts/setup_quickstart.sh

# (optional) install cloud extras
make install-extras  # adds boto3 + google-cloud-aiplatform

# 2. Initialize the local SQLite backing store
make db-init

# 3. Seed OPA with the sample policies
make seed

# 4. Fire up the stack (API, MCP server, demo agent, approvals UI, OPA, OTEL)
make dev

# 5. Run the change-request storyline (allowed → needs approval → blocked)
make demo-e2e

# 6. Verify the signed audit trail
make audit-verify
make coverage            # coverage gate
make mutation            # run mutation smoke test
# optional: auto-provision Grafana + Prometheus
./scripts/run_grafana_stack.sh
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose (Production Ready)

```bash
# Pull the latest release images
docker-compose -f docker-compose.release.yml pull

# Start all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.release.yml up -d

# Or build from source
docker-compose up --build -d
```

**Available Services:**
- **API Server**: http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI with auto-generated docs)
- **Approvals UI**: http://localhost:8501 (Streamlit interface)
- **MCP Server**: http://localhost:8001 (Model Context Protocol)
- **Demo Agent**: http://localhost:8002 (Example agent implementation)

### Option 3: Individual Docker Images

```bash
# Pull specific images
docker pull ghcr.io/jlov7/switchboard:latest-api
docker pull ghcr.io/jlov7/switchboard:latest-mcp
docker pull ghcr.io/jlov7/switchboard:latest-approvals-ui
docker pull ghcr.io/jlov7/switchboard:latest-demo-agent

- `make mutation` – mutation smoke test via mutmut
- `tox` – py311 environment with in-memory sqlite
- `pytest` – unit + integration coverage, now including property tests and chaos fixtures

Telemetry: OTLP traces + metrics, structlog JSON logs with redacted arguments.

## Persistence & Configuration

- `SWITCHBOARD_APPROVAL_BACKEND` – defaults to `memory`; set to `persistent` when you want the shared database-backed queue
- `SWITCHBOARD_DATABASE_URL` – defaults to `sqlite+aiosqlite:///data/switchboard.db`; set to Postgres DSN for multi-instance deployments
- `scripts/init_db.py` – bootstraps the schema; run via `make db-init`

## Telemetry Controls

- `SWITCHBOARD_ENABLE_TELEMETRY` – opt-in flag (defaults to disabled); set to `true` to emit OTLP traces/metrics
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` – override to point at your collector (defaults to `http://localhost:4317`)
- `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=1` – hard-disable all OpenTelemetry SDK wiring if you need a zero-overhead run

## Cloud Adapter Cheatsheet

| Adapter | Enable | Mode | Env knobs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AWS Bedrock AgentCore | `SWITCHBOARD_ENABLE_BEDROCK=true` | `SWITCHBOARD_AWS_MODE` (`dry-run` / `live`) | `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_BEDROCK_AGENT_ID`, `AWS_BEDROCK_AGENT_ALIAS_ID` | Requires `pip install .[aws]` for live mode; dry-run echoes payloads |
| Vertex Agent Engine | `SWITCHBOARD_ENABLE_VERTEX=true` | `SWITCHBOARD_GCP_MODE` (`dry-run` / `live`) | `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `VERTEX_AGENT_ID`, `VERTEX_LOCATION` | Requires `pip install .[gcp]`; uses Google ADC for auth when live |

Both adapters default to **dry-run** to keep demos and tests deterministic. Flip to `live` when you want to hit real services.

## Testing & Evaluation

- `make qa` – lint (`ruff`, `black`), type check (`mypy`), tests
- `tox` – py311 environment with in-memory sqlite + hypothesis hooks
- `pytest` – now includes persistent store tests, adapter dry-runs, audit verification, and API integration tests
- `evals/runner.py` – extended runner emits latency + routing summaries; plug in your own Graph2Eval/SWE-Bench-Pro tasks
- Property-based testing foundation via `hypothesis` (see `tests/property/` once added)
